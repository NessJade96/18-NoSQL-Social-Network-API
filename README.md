## Commit notes:

1. Read through all planning documentation, set up file structure and begin planning notes. Created User model, with some links to userController established.

2. Thoughts and User models, routes and controllers created.

3. Reactions schema(model) created

4. Added the reaciton api requests to the thought controllers. Additionally I pushed the thought id to the user when a user creates a thought.

5. Created the add and remove friends from the user controller, removed seed data that isnt required. api/users and api/thoughts base routes are working in insomnia

\*\* okay so you need to check you have met each requirement + bonuses, then go through and seed the DB in insomnia with api calls.
Then once all checks are thorough - record walkthrough video.

THOUGHT (and REACTION schema) contorller add: Use a getter method to format the timestamp on query (createdAt) AND -
THOUGHT Schema Settings:
User controller: finish function(getSingleUser) !! still broken
